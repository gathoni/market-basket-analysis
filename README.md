Suppose that you are running an e-commerce site, it would be nice to know what combinations of products tend to be bought at same time. Then, you can ‘recommend’ a list of products for your customers based on what they have already bought or are about to buy. This is basically what many of us call as ‘Recommendation Engine’ today.
One of the ways to find this out is to use an algorithm called <b>‘Association Rules’</b> or often called as <b>‘Market Basket Analysis’</b>.
